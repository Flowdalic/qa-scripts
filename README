How to get a script added.
==========================

File a bug report assigned to the qa team. The qa team will add the script to
the repo or give you access to the repo

How to get output on the webpage added.
=======================================

Once your script is in the repo, infra needs to run the script and someone needs
to add the appropriate link to the webpage.

Important details:
- How often to run your script, normally daily is good enough.
- Any arguments needed for the script? (OR how to run it)
- Output is normally text but can be html too, must be static.
- Must not link outside of gentoo.org for integrity purposes. It is ideal to
  maintain a closed system, output generated on the web host, etc.
